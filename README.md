# TechFest-WebDev-Competition

I participated in TechFest organised by CodeGirls - Consulnet Coorporation Held at MAJU
-------------------------------------------------------------
Competition: Web Development

Time: 5 hours

Scenario: Create a to-do list app where you can add, group, save your to-dos, and add due dates, descriptions, and attachments. Also, add a feature to make a to-do recurring, such as daily or weekly. The interface should be easy enough for the user to do it on the go. Also, extra points for making it responsive. You can do the following to a certain “to do”.
Mark it done 
Delete it 
Move it to some other date 
Add it to another group
Edit it
